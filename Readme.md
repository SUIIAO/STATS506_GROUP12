## Stats 506 Final Project, Group 12

This repo contains files of our final project "Multinomial Logistic Regression (all vs reference) using IRIS" in Stats 506, Fall 2018.

### R
The script [Group_12.R](./R/Group_12.R) has R code for our project. 

### Examples
 
The source code for the Rmarkdown notes can be found at:
  - [Examples/Rmarkdown.Rmd](./Examples/Rmarkdown.Rmd)

Stata examples presented in class can be found at:
  - [Examples/Stata](./Examples/Stata)

The script [bootstrap_iqr_example.R](Examples/R/bootstrap_iqr_example.R) has code
for the first example from the notes on resampling techniques. 

A cross-validation example in the context of ridge regression is available as 
[xvalidate_ridge.R](Examples/R/xvalidate_ridge.R).

A data.table example comparing situations ruturning the same or a different
number of rows when using a `by` statement is available as
[data.table_number_of_rows.R](Examples/R/data.table_number_of_rows.R).

Examples from our discussion of parallel computing can be found in 
[Examples/R/parallel](Examples/R/parallel/).

Exmaples from our discussion of batch computing and job scheduling are in
[Examples/R/r_batch](Examples/R/r_batch).


### Case Studies

The RECS 2009 case study looking at the proportions of home types is availble as 
[case_studies/case_study_1_RECS.R](./case_studies/case_study_1_RECS.R).

The Chick Weights case study using the bootstrap to estimate uncertainty in the 
median weight is available at 
[case_studies/chick_weight_data.table.R](case_studies/chick_weight_data.table.R).


### Solutions to problem sets

Source code for problem set solutions is available under [solutions](./solutions).

Output from source files is available at the course [homepage](https://jbhender.github.io/Stats506/F18).

Source code from the Linux Shell Skills quiz is available at [./Examples/midterm/bucket_phys.sh].

The S4 and S3 code with solutions from the S3 & S4 methods quiz are available at [./solutions/S3_S4_Quiz/].
